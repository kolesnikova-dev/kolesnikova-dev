## Hi there, I'm Nika ðŸ‘‹
<hr> <br>
<p>I'm a software engineer.</p>
<p>ðŸ‘¯ My favorite sport is building full-stack MERN apps, as well as learning web scraping and data visualization with Python.</p>
<p>ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a plant journal with Next, as well as features for my portfolio website, such as enhancing its responsiveness and adding more information.</p>
